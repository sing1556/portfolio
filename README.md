This is my portfolio website deign which I made for my UXD assignment. TBH I really like this design and I wanted to make this design on my own website. And with this assignment, I get a chance for making this as a proper website. Very frankly, I know that this is not the perfect one because there are lot of things which can be improved, but i really enjoyed this assignment and tried to work hard. I have difficulties in Aria Labels. That thing makes me de-motivated but I am keep trying to understand that thing. Lat but not least, i really learned so many things with this assignment, i know that we learned things in our classes too, but this was an oppotunity for us to use everything which we learned in our previous whole semester and this semester. I want to thank Abhay sir for teaching us and so well in both previous semesters and who gave us this opportunity and was always be there to help or teach again when we didn't understand something.
